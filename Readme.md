# Adds Icon to Sublime Text Shell Menu Item

I was missing icon in the sublime text shell menu item for long time. Some people also asked for one in the sublime text forum. But the devs never added it. So I decided to add the icon myself.

### How to

Just download the 'Add Shell Icon.reg' file to any folder in your pc and then double click it. Click yes / ok to any further prompt. After that, right click on any text file and you should see sublime text icon before 'Open with Sublime Text' menu item.
